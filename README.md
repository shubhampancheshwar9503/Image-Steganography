Overview
This Python project implements a simple image steganography tool that allows users to hide text data within an image using the Pillow library for image processing and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). Steganography is the art of hiding information within another seemingly innocuous medium.

Features
Encoding: Embed any text message into an image.
Decoding: Retrieve the hidden text from an encoded image.
User-Friendly GUI: Utilizes Tkinter for a straightforward and intuitive user interface.
Secure: Basic level of security through the use of a password.
Technologies Used
Pillow (PIL): For image processing and manipulation.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
Usage
Launch the application.
Select an image file for encoding or decoding.
Enter the text message to be encoded or click the 'Decode' button for decoding.
Follow on-screen instructions.
