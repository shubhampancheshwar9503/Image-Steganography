Image Steganography is a fascinating technique that allows you to hide secret information within an image. In this project, we’ll use Python, along with the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI), and the Pillow library for image manipulation.

Here’s a high-level overview of how the process works:

Select an Image: First, you choose an image (the “cover image”) that will hide your secret data. It could be a photograph, artwork, or any image file.

Encode the Secret Data: Next, you encode your secret message or file into the cover image. This involves altering the pixel values of the image in a way that’s imperceptible to the human eye. The secret data is embedded within the least significant bits of the image pixels.

Save the Modified Image: The modified image, now containing the hidden data, is saved as a new file. This file can be shared with others, and they won’t know that it contains hidden information.

Decoding: To retrieve the hidden data, someone else can use the same software to decode the modified image. The decoding process extracts the secret message or file from the altered pixel values.

Tkinter provides a simple way to create a user-friendly interface where users can select an image and input their secret message. The Pillow library allows us to manipulate the image pixels and perform the encoding and decoding steps.
